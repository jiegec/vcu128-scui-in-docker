# vcu128-scui

Why: SCUI does not support Debian Bullseye. Run it in Ubuntu 20.04 in Docker.

Steps:

1. Build the docker image by running build.sh
2. Download system controller ui from https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vcu128-es1.html#resources
3. Extract in current directory
4. Run start.sh
5. You should see the window show up
